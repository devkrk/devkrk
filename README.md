<b> Hi there 👋 </b></br>
I'm Jaroslaw. I work as a full stack developer. I started developing in 2014, and since 2016 I have been doing it commercially.
Every day my clients have new problems and I try to provide them with the best software solutions 🖥.
I devote my free time after work to expanding my skills by programming and creating open-source projects 🔓, which you will find below.
I hope that my materials / algorithms will help someone in learning 📚, and who knows, maybe someone will use them to create their own program 👨‍🎓
